    content: `San Bao is built on a personalised approach to wellbeing, inspired by "three treasures": body, energy and spirit. My aim is to accompany you towards harmony with attentive and tailor-made guidance.

Since 2010 I have explored many therapeutic disciplines: Shiatsu, Qi Nei Zang, Reiki, herbalism, naturopathy and geobiology as well as numerous workshops that deepen my understanding of the body and its energies.

These experiences let me offer holistic support that combines bodywork, lifestyle advice and careful listening so you can become the actor of your own balance. I look forward to meeting you!`,
    more: `I founded San Bao because I believe in a personalised approach to your well-being, as each individual is unique. The name "San Bao" in Chinese medecine means the "three treasures": Jing (the vital essence), Qi (the energetic flow), Shen (the spirit). I apply the symbol of the 3 treasures working on the body, energy and spirit.

My mission is to support you on the path to harmony, I'll be your guide to holistic well-being.

Passionate about therapeutic touch, I have been developing my skills through various trainings since 2010:

• Shiatsu and Qi Nei Zang:
   - well-being shiatsu (Masunaga) with Philippe Vandenabeele – Shinzuikai 2013/2014.
   - therapeutic shiatsu with Ivan Bel – EBST – (whom I also assisted for a year after my training) and Philippe Banai (Ryoho Shiatsu – www.ryohoshiatsu.com) for 4 years.
   - specialisation in Qi Nei Zang (or Chi Nei Tsang, "organ massage" – www.idoschool.be)

• Reiki and Touch for Health (International Reiki Centre and www.ressourcetoit.be).

• Herbalism (with Anysia Ducastel) and naturopathy (Phytocorsa and E.N.S.A. European Naturopathic School Association)

• Geobiology: training with Alain de Luzan – Geobios – in 2019; taking the environment into account for complete well-being.

• Several workshops help deepen my knowledge, among others: Swedish massage training in 2010, TCM courses with Raphael Piotto in 2015, therapeutic and fluidic shiatsu with Bernard Bouheret, family Thai Gua Sha course with Gilles Thuriaux in 2019, bioenergy at the Résonnances Vivantes centre, palpatory anatomy (EEM), Seiki with Frans Copers (2022) and various introductions to hand and foot reflexology.

My goal is that you become the actor of your own balance.
These different universes allow me to offer you comprehensive and personalised support based on bodywork, lifestyle advice and attentive listening, going beyond occasional treatments to help you take charge of your well-being, whether to relieve stress, pain or simply to take care of yourself. Of course, all advice is given with the agreement of your doctor and respecting any ongoing medical treatments. I do not replace a doctor under any circumstances.

Looking forward to meeting you!
Christel`

        more: "Shiatsu… or how to rebalance the movements of Ki throughout the body.\n\nShiatsu (which means “finger pressure”) is a massage of Japanese origin that uses meridians and acupuncture points, aiming to maintain or restore a smooth and harmonious circulation of vital energy (Qi in Chinese or Ki in Japanese). It therefore acts on the physical, mental, and emotional body.\n\nIt is practiced as a relaxation massage, an energetic massage, or a therapeutic massage to meet specific needs (bereavement, dysmenorrhea, digestive problems, sleep issues, stress, burn-out, etc.). In the case of therapeutic massage, it relies on the principles of TCM (traditional Chinese medicine).\n\nShiatsu allows you to reconnect with your own body and also with your emotions, as everything is linked…\n\nEach session is different because it is based on your needs at that precise moment. The rhythm, pressure, and meridians engaged will depend solely on your needs during the appointment.\n\nShiatsu can be performed in a single session or regularly (as a preventive or maintenance practice, for example, since it is recommended to have a session at each change of season according to the recipient’s feelings and needs). If the issue is long-standing, several sessions may be necessary.\n\nFinally, the shiatsu session can also be part of a broader program and accompany naturopathy follow-ups to help the body eliminate toxins, for example.\n\nShiatsu is practiced clothed, on a futon. If you cannot lie on the floor, we will practice shiatsu on a massage table or seated—I adapt to your possibilities. The massage consists of a series of pressures on energy points, mobilizations, stretches, and applications along the meridians. If necessary, moxibustion (warming an acupuncture point with moxa) may also be used during the session. To be comfortable during the shiatsu session, I advise wearing loose-fitting clothes. The session lasts 1 hour and costs €65.\n\nAre you affiliated with Mutualia? Good news : shiatsu is now included intheir supplementary health insurance! Your shiatsu session will therefore be partially reimbursed (check conditions with Mutualia).\n\nIt is also possible to have a discovery session; this massage is performed on a chair and lasts only 20 minutes. This allows us to get to know each other! Chair massage is perfect for the workplace; if you want to offer a wellness break to your employees, don’t hesitate!\n\nRegarding contraindications, shiatsu is not performed on open wounds, in case of fever, phlebitis, or cardiovascular diseases.\n\nTHE SHIATSU OR QI NEI ZANG PRACTITIONER IN NO CASE REPLACES A DOCTOR. A SHIATSU OR QI NEI ZANG SESSION COMPLEMENTS MEDICAL TREATMENT BUT DOES NOT REPLACE IT."

Bechamp.\n\nThe naturopath is, more than anything, a guide who, based on the vitality assessment carried out, proposes a personalised programme of vital hygiene to strengthen the body’s self-healing capacities, detoxify and make up for any deficiencies.\n\nThe vital hygiene programme we will establish together will take into account your family, social and professional environment; your eating and sporting habits; your stress level, the quality of your sleep and your appetite, etc.\n\nThe programme recommends the use of plants, includes detoxifying and remineralising cures but also offers massages (shiatsu/Qi Nei Zang) or hydrotherapy techniques. The first session lasts 1h30 and costs €80, and its aim is to understand your environment, your habits, your lifestyle and your expectations. At the end of this vitality assessment, I prepare a personalised protocol that runs over several weeks. This protocol will provide advice on food and other aspects of daily life (activities, plants, relaxation, etc.)\n\nFollow-up sessions, optional, last 1 hour and cost €65.\n\nWant to know more? Book now or contact me!\n\nPlease note thqt the naturopath in no way replaces the doctor but accompanies you while taking ongoing medical treatments into account."
